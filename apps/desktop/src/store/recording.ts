/**
 * Recording-session UI state.
 *
 * Owns the *frontend* affordances around an active capture — the timer
 * + Pause/Stop button row + the meeting handle returned by
 * `heron_start_capture`. The actual audio pipeline lives behind the
 * daemon (Gap #7 wired Start/Stop in the desktop UI to
 * `POST /v1/meetings` and `POST /v1/meetings/{id}/end`); this store
 * tracks "we asked the daemon to record, here's the meeting id it
 * gave us back" so the Stop button has a typed handle without
 * re-querying the meetings list.
 *
 * Fields:
 *
 *   - `recordingStart` — `Date.now()` when the user confirmed the
 *     consent gate. The `<Recording>` page derives the elapsed-time
 *     display from this; `null` when no session is active.
 *   - `meetingId` — id of the daemon-side meeting started for this
 *     session. `null` when idle, OR when a meeting started outside
 *     this app (e.g., CLI start) drove us to /recording — in that
 *     case the Stop handler falls back to the active-meeting id from
 *     `useMeetingsStore`.
 *   - `paused` — UI flag for the Pause button. Stub-only; the real
 *     audio pipeline doesn't yet expose pause/resume.
 *
 * Actions:
 *
 *   - `start(meetingId)` — seed `recordingStart` + remember the
 *     daemon-issued meeting handle. Called from the Home page after
 *     `heron_start_capture` resolves Ok and the consent gate
 *     confirmed.
 *   - `stop()`  — clear `recordingStart` and `meetingId`. Called by
 *     the "Stop & Save" button after `heron_end_meeting` resolves.
 *   - `togglePause()` — flip the local `paused` flag. UI-only.
